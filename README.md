# jumpcutGUI
If someone who can't code made a simple GUI for a python script... oh wait this is exactly what this is
As said, this is just a GUI, the actual python script can be found [here](https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter "here").

------------
You need python (obviously), ffmpeg and all these python dependencies:
- Pillow
- audiotsm
- scipy
- numpy
- pytube1

they can also be found in the requirements file of the original repo
