# jumpcutGUI


This is just a GUI, the actual python script can be found [here](https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter "here"), however, it can also be downloaded from the app itself.

------------
You need python (obviously), [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html "ffmpeg") and all these python dependencies:
- Pillow
- audiotsm
- scipy
- numpy
- pytube

they can also be found in the requirements file of the original repo or be installed directly through the app

Both python and ffmpeg must be in PATH
